# Adaptive question behaviour for GraphChecker questions

This Moodle question behavior is based on [qbehaviour_adaptive_adapted_for_coderunner](https://github.com/trampgeek/moodle-qbehaviour_adaptive_adapted_for_coderunner) created by Richard Lobb, University of Canterbury, New Zealand, with tiny changes to support [GraphChecker](https://github.com/graphchecker/moodle-qtype_graphchecker) instead of CodeRunner. It provides the caching of check results needed to prevent rerunning checks every time the result page is viewed.

For information on how to install this question behavior, see the
[GraphChecker installation instructions](https://github.com/graphchecker/moodle-qtype_graphchecker/blob/master/INSTALL.md).
